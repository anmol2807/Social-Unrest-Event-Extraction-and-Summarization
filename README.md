# Social-Unrest-Event-Extraction-and-Summarization
The Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED) is the highest quality, most widely used, real-time data and analysis source on political violence and protest in the developing world. Practitioners, researchers, and governments depend on ACLED for the latest reliable information on current conflict and disorder patterns [1]. However, the task of populating the database with events is currently carried manually by human volunteers across the globe. This makes the whole process time consuming and requires human efforts to train the volunteers and curate the data collected from them. Hence, we present a system which will automate the complete task of collecting data related to unrest events from various online sources and providing summarized text for every event. Additionally, every event will also be identified whether it is related to election violence or not. Experimental results on past data from ACLED demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.
